# `ansible-pygit2`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wizardsoftheweb/ansible-pygit2.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/wizardsoftheweb/ansible-pygit2)

This Ansible role installs `pygit2` and its dependency `libgit2` either in a `virtualenv` or globally.

More documentation later. I'm trying to see if this actually works on not my machine.

## Current State

Things mostly work. I keep breaking one OS by fixing another OS. It's far more complicated than it lets on. I was super proud of myself when I finally got Alpine to work, but I had totally broken Ubuntu in the process.
